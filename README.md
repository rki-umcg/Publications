# Publications
This project contains finalized scripts that have been used for data analysis in publications. Thus, when your manuscript is published in a journal you can add the code to a seperate folder. For example 'Wilbrink et al. [year] [journal, abbreviated] [doi] ', I left the title out as this can be quite long. You can put all other information in the README.file inside the project.
